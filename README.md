How Data Can Humanize the Hiring Loop 
 
In a world flooded with job applications, the silence after clicking “Apply” has become deafening.  
But what if **data** — not automation alone — could make hiring more transparent, fair, and human?  

### 🔍 Data Perspective  
Most companies track applicant volume but not **response efficiency**. By applying analytics to hiring metrics, we can measure and improve engagement.  

| Metric | What It Means | Ideal Range |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Response Rate | % of applicants receiving any update | >70% |
| Feedback Loop Time | Avg. days to send feedback | <7 days |
| Personalization Index | Degree of customized replies | 60–80% |

Instead of ghosting, imagine dashboards that alert recruiters to follow-up delays.  
The goal isn’t automation overload — it’s *data empathy*.  

✨ **Takeaway:** Let’s make hiring measurable and meaningful again.
